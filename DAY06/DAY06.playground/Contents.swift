Checkpoint 3

The problem is called fizz buzz, and has been used in job interviews, university entrance tests, and more for as long as I can remember. Your goal is to loop from 1 through 100, and for each number:

If it’s a multiple of 3, print “Fizz”
If it’s a multiple of 5, print “Buzz”
If it’s a multiple of 3 and 5, print “FizzBuzz”
Otherwise, just print the number.

for i in 1...100 {
    var fizzbuzz = ""
    
    if i.isMultiple(of: 3) {
        fizzbuzz = "Fizz"
    }
    
    if i.isMultiple(of: 5) {
        fizzbuzz += "Buzz"
    }
    
    print(fizzbuzz.isEmpty ? i : fizzbuzz)
}
